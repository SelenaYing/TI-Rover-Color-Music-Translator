# 🎨 TI-Rover-Color-Music-Translator 🎵

A **hands-on educational tool** using the **TI-Rover** and **TI-nSpire** to **play music through color**. Students compose music by arranging color cards—each assigned to a musical note—and watch the Rover perform their compositions!

---

## 🧠 What It Teaches

This project is designed to help students explore:

* 🎨 **Color theory**
* 🎼 **Music composition basics**
* 🐍 **Python programming on TI-nSpire**
* 🤖 **Hands-on robotics with TI-Rover**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step-by-Step

1. Prepare **8 color cards** for the 8 notes: C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, A4, B4, C5
2. Run `1.5 ColorRecording Program` to scan and record RGB values of the cards
3. Use **the same color cards** to compose your music (lay them out in order)
4. Run `1.9 PlayMusic Program` to let the Rover read the cards and play your tune!

## 🧪 Program Details

### `1.5` ColorRecording Program

* Reads RGB values from each color card
* Assigns each color to a musical note
* Saves the RGB data to lists on page `1.7`

### `1.9` PlayMusic Program

* Recalls the RGB values from `1.7`
* Moves the Rover across your laid-out music sheet
* Detects color cards, matches to notes, and plays sound via speaker

### `1.12` ColorDetector Program

* Live reads and averages RGB values
* **Does not** save to the list
* Use it to test if a color is distinguishable or update `1.7` manually

---

## 🔧 Recording Tips (`1.4`)

To ensure accurate playback:

* Use **the exact same color cards** (same brand, texture, pack)
* Record and play under the **same lighting conditions**
* **Keep the Rover still** while recording
* After recording all 8 cards, check `1.7`:
  If any two colors have all 3 RGB values within ±10, pick a more distinct color

  > Example: `(80, 200, 100)` and `(70, 200, 90)` → too close

### 💡 Tip

To change just one color, use `1.12 ColorDetector` to get the RGB and manually update `1.7`.

---

## 🔊 Playback Tips (`1.8`)

* Connect speaker to **OUT3** on the TI-Rover
* Lay out your **color-coded music sheet** flat on the ground
* Run `1.9 PlayMusic Program` to perform your music!

---

## 🎯 Educational Goal

This project is perfect for STEM classrooms, makerspaces, or student-led workshops. It turns abstract coding and musical ideas into something **physical, playful, and memorable**.
